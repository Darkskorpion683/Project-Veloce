Instructions:

To access fullscreen ***Press F***

Upon pressing play, you will enter a race selector that starts with one race and adds more as you play. 
Once you have selected the map, the race will start shortly

Before the race begins, you could gain an extra speed boost by spinning your wheels and releasing them and just before the race starts.

***Hold down the 'c' key to begin wheel spin***

***Release the 'c' key to end wheel spin***

Once the race has begun, you will rapidly gain speed. Once the needle reaches a certain desired rpm, you will need to upshift.

***Press the 'e' key to upshift***

If you shift gears too early or too late, you can downshift to the previous gear to continue gaining speed.

***Press the 'q' key to downshift***

At any point during the race, you can choose to activate your nitrous, which will temporarily increase the acceleration of your car by a large amount, but it is a one-time use, so be strategic with it.

***Press the 'shift' key to activate nitrous***

Once the race is concluded, you will gain money depending on what place you finish  
With the money gained, you can look to upgrade your vehicle

Upon entering the garage, you can spend your money on any of the available upgrades, or you can look to purchase a new car altogether 
From here, you can continue racing the same race or choose another race.
But be warned, the higher the level the race is, the harder the opponents get.
